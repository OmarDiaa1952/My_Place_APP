# Share a Place

This project demonstrates a full-stack web application for sharing location-based experiences. It leverages modern JavaScript (ES6+), Webpack for bundling and optimization, and integrates with the Google Maps API (or potentially an alternative like Leaflet/OpenStreetMap). Users can pinpoint locations on a map, add descriptions and images, and generate shareable links.

## Key Skills Demonstrated

*   **Front-end Development:** Proficient use of JavaScript (ES6+), HTML, and CSS to create a dynamic and interactive user interface. Experience with handling user input, form submissions, and asynchronous operations (fetching data, interacting with the map API). Knowledge of UI/UX principles for a user-friendly experience.
*   **Module Bundling and Optimization:** Utilizing Webpack to bundle JavaScript modules, optimize assets, and improve website performance. Experience with configuring Webpack for both development and production environments.
*   **Mapping API Integration:** Integrating with a mapping API (Google Maps or alternatives) to display interactive maps, handle location selection, and potentially implement features like geocoding (converting addresses to coordinates) and reverse geocoding (converting coordinates to addresses).
*   **Data Handling (if applicable):** If the project involves storing and retrieving user-generated location data, it demonstrates experience with data persistence (e.g., using a backend database or local storage).
*   **Version Control (Git):** Using Git for version control, demonstrating collaboration skills and the ability to manage code changes effectively.
